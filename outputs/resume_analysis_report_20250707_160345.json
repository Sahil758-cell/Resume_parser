Demonstrates a solid understanding of both \ntheoretical principles and practical applications through academic coursework and hands-on projects. Skilled in using industry-\nstandard tools and software for simulation and analysis. Possesses excellent problem-solving abilities, strong analytical skills, \nand effective communication capabilities. Eager to contribute to innovative projects and advance in the field of electrical \nengineering.\nAdhyan Pranil Agrawal\nTrainee Engineer\nStatic Electricals | Pune, Maharashtra\n - \nAs a trainee engineer in a transformer manufacturing company should possess a strong foundation in electrical engineering, \nalong with knowledge of transformer design, testing, and quality control. Proficiency in understanding of electrical circuits, \nadherence to safety regulations, and effective communication skills are also crucial for success in this role.\nFeb 2023\nFeb 2023\nInterplay of Mechanical and Electrical Parameters in Design and Development of E-\nVehicle\n - \nAn interesting project that blends technical concepts with creativity for sustainable transportation is designing and modelling an \nelectric vehicle (EV). Typically, it entails the following:\n\u25cf Powertrain Modelling: This is the process of putting the battery, electric motor, and power electronics of an electric vehicle \ninto a mathematical model. The performance, range, and energy efficiency of the EV are predicted and simulated with the \naid of this model.\n\u25cf Vehicle Design: This concentrates on the aerodynamics, battery location, motor choice, and overall passenger and cargo \nspace of the EV.\nApr 2023\nApr\n2024\nUnderground Cable Fault Detector\n - \nDetecting fault source in Underground Cable is difficult and entire line is to be dug in order to check entire line and fix faults. So \nhere we propose a cable fault detection over IOT that detects the exact fault position over IOT that makes repairing work very \neasy. The potential of your project is broken down as follows:\n\u25cf Real-time Monitoring: By integrating IoT into your system, you can keep an eye on the health of your cables from a distance. \nPreventive maintenance and early identification of any problems are made possible by this, which lowers the possibility of \nunplanned outages.\n\u25cf Increased Efficiency: You can drastically cut down on the amount of excavation space required for repair by precisely locating \nthe fault. This results in cheaper prices and quicker repair times.\nJul 2022\nDec 2022\nCore Skills\nPower System, MATLAB, AutoCAD, Circuit Design, Microsoft Office, Preventive Maintenance, Project Management,\nLoad Calculation, Innovative, Communication Skills, Teamwork, Organizational Skills\nCertificates\nPublications\nEducation\nDr. D.

By outlining the \nmain parts of an electric vehicle system, such as the control unit, power electronics, energy storage system (battery), \nand electric motor. These constituents provide the fundamental structure of the electric vehicle (EV), facilitating its \npropulsion, energy storage, and general functionality. A universal charging system that can safely and efficiently \ncharge the majority of EVs in a variety of exterior conditions is necessary due to the rise in EV usage.\nMay 2024\n",

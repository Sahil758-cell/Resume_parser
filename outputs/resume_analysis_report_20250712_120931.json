The system employs advanced image processing and machine \nlearning algorithms for precise identification and verification. Features include real-time data \ncapture, secure storage, and detailed reporting. This project showcases expertise in Python \nprogramming, computer vision (OpenCV), and biometric authentication systems, providing a \nreliable and efficient solution for attendance management.\nSalon Management System\nSystem Based Application\nDeveloped a desktop-based application using C# to streamline salon operations, including \ncustomer management, appointment scheduling, service tracking, and billing. Designed an intuitive \nuser interface for seamless navigation and integrated backend support for efficient data handling. \nThe system enhanced operational efficiency, improved customer experience, and demonstrated \nproficiency in object-oriented programming and desktop application development.\nIoT-Based Gas Leakage Detector\nAs part of my college mini project, I developed an IoT-based gas leakage detection system that uses \nan MQ6 gas sensor and an Arduino microcontroller to monitor the presence of LPG gas in the \nsurrounding environment. The system was designed to detect leaks in real time and alert users, \nhelping to prevent hazards such as explosions and health risks. A simple Java-based frontend was \nused for user interaction, while the backend logic and data handling were managed through \nArduino. This project demonstrates practical skills in embedded systems, sensor integration, and \nsafety automation, with applications in home safety, industrial gas pipelines, and CNG automobile \nsystems. It is also scalable for future integration into smart homes and IoT-enabled environments.\n",
